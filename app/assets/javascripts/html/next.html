                <p>Ruby Webs will contact you to go over the information about what you would like your site to
                do for you.  We will then create an initial website template for you to review on our development
                server.  We will make every attempt to have this completed with 24 - 48 hours.  After the initial website
                is reviewed, upon your acceptance of our contract, we will work together to shape and mold the website
                into its final form.</p>
                
                <p>The final website may take days, to weeks, to months depending on the needs and changes necessary to completed
                the website, although most will be finished in a few days to weeks.  We believe that websites will need change,
                so it is not uncommon for changes to be requested and made at later dates.  No websites final layout will be set in stone.
                </p>
                
                <p>During this time, Ruby Webs will help you find a domain name, and will setup initial analytics tracking to start
                gathering website traffic data.  We will also begin activly working on increasing the rankings for search engines.</p>
